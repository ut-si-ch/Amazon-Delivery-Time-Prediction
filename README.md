##  Problem Statement  
In the fast-growing e-commerce ecosystem, **on-time delivery** is crucial.  
This project predicts **order delivery time** using:  

- Distance (KM)  
- Traffic & Weather conditions  
- Agent details (age, rating, vehicle)  
- Order category  

This allows companies to optimize **logistics, ETAs, and customer satisfaction**.

---

##  Project Workflow  

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned raw data and handled missing values.  
   - Created new features: `Distance_KM`, `Time_to_Pickup`, etc.  
   - Encoded categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**.  

2. **EDA & Feature Importance**
   - Identified distribution of delivery times.  
   - Plotted traffic/weather effects.  
   - Top important features:  
     - Category_Grocery  
     - Agent Rating  
     - Distance_KM  
     - Traffic Conditions  

3. **Modeling**
   - Trained and compared:  
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree 
     - Random Forest  
     - XGBoost  
     - **LightGBM (Best)**  

4. **MLOps**
   - Tracked experiments in **MLflow**.  
   - Logged metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²) and hyperparameters.  
   - Registered best-performing model.  

5. **Deployment**
   - Built **Streamlit UI** for real-time predictions.
